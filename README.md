# Matter Kit - Testimonials Custom Post Type
**A plugin for creating a testimonials custom post type.**

## Installing the plugin
Install this plugin as you would other WordPress plugins, by uploading the directory to the plugins folder, or downloading the zip and uploading through the WordPress GUI. This is not a plugin one would use on a non Matter Kit website, because there are dependencies on the parent framework.

## Notes
This plugin creates a custom post type for testimonials and a taxonomy for testimonial categories. This gets autohooked onto the ACF Grid flexible layout as an option to pull categories of testimonials out in the page builder.

By default, the flexible content is removed from entries for this custom post type, because only basic data is needed.

Post thumbnails are included in this CPT and default ordering within grid outputs is set by menu order, with title secondary, ascending.
